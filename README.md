# Move That for you

Foundry VTT module for granting players permissions to move/rotate tiles and tokens.

## Usage

Once the module is activated for tiles and/or tokens via **Tile Controls** and **Token Controls** settings a new button will be added to their HUDs:

Toggle it to enable/disable the ability for players to move the tile or token they normally shouldn't be able to:

Right-clicking the button will grant the players permission to rotate them:

Tile placement can also be restricted to bounding boxes you can draw by either going to modules settings > **Boundary Configuration** or pressing the shortcut key **Shift+B**.
