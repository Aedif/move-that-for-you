# Move That for you

Foundry VTT module for granting players permissions to move/rotate tiles and tokens.

## Usage

Once the module is activated for tiles and/or tokens via **Tile Controls** and **Token Controls** settings a new button will be added to their HUDs:

Toggle it to enable/disable the ability for players to move the tile or token they normally shouldn't be able to:

Right-clicking the button will grant the players permission to rotate them:

Movement can also be restricted to boundaries you can draw by either going to modules settings > **Boundary Configuration** or pressing the shortcut key **Shift+B**.

## Insert Permission Button to HUD

This setting which is enabled by default will insert the above mentioned button to Tile/Token HUDs. However you may choose to disable this and control `move` and `rotate` permissions via flags instead:

Toggle `move` permissions for currently selected Tile/Tokens:

```js
const controlled = canvas.tiles.controlled.length
  ? canvas.tiles.controlled
  : canvas.tokens.controlled;

for (const placeable of controlled) {
  const allowMove = Boolean(placeable.document.getFlag('move-that-for-you', 'allowPlayerMove'));
  if (allowMove) placeable.document.unsetFlag('move-that-for-you', 'allowPlayerMove');
  else placeable.document.setFlag('move-that-for-you', 'allowPlayerMove', true);
}
```

Toggle `rotate` permissions for currently selected Tile/Tokens:

```js
const controlled = canvas.tiles.controlled.length
  ? canvas.tiles.controlled
  : canvas.tokens.controlled;

for (const placeable of controlled) {
  const allowRotate = Boolean(placeable.document.getFlag('move-that-for-you', 'allowPlayerRotate'));
  if (allowRotate) placeable.document.unsetFlag('move-that-for-you', 'allowPlayerRotate');
  else placeable.document.setFlag('move-that-for-you', 'allowPlayerRotate', true);
}
```
